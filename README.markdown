## What language is it written in?

It's written in arduino language code

## What's its current status?

Currently under early devlopment

Roadmap includes the following goals:

* working with arduino leonardo for HID-support
* direct value input into every prgram you want

## How to install?

It's very easy. Just coby the files into your arduino sketchfolder and wire your system.

## Wich hardware is used?

Currently are different parts used

* Arduino Uno
* Adafruit motorshield + AFmotor library
* 200 Rev Stepper (Pololu, 10V, 500mA)
* terminal switches - connected to D2/D3
* MLX90614 IR thermometer
